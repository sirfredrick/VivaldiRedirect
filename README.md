![Vivaldi Redirect](icon.png)

Vivaldi Redirect is a ~~Chrome~~ Vivaldi Extension that redirects normal web requests to their counterpart URLs from Vivaldi Browser's default bookmarks to support Vivaldi.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this extension is to go to the [Chrome Webstore page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).

If you want to install it manually then...

Go to releases and download the files into a directory of your choosing. Go to:
~~`chrome://extensions`~~ `vivaldi://extension` 

or go to:

`Vivaldi Button-> Tools-> Extensions`

And enable Developer mode then click on Load unpacked and select the directory from earlier.

The extension should then be installed!
